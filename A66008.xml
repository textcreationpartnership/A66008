            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE Throne of <hi>David</hi> was ſet up and eſtabliſh'd by God himſelf, who (at that time) reſerved to himſelf the particular appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah.</hi> He firſt caus'd <hi>Saul,</hi> and then <hi>David</hi> to be anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted King. And yet, (notwithſtanding God's own appointment) there were ſeveral Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinies, Seditions, and Rebellions of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; which is a ſure Evidence, that no Right of Government can be ſo Juſt, no Title to the Crown ſo Unqueſtionable and firm, which ſhall not be liable to the Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Claims, and Diſturbances, of wicked and Ambitious men. Certainly no man could
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60508:3"/>queſtion Gods Right and Power of Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or that <hi>David</hi> was the Perſon nam'd by him for their King. Theſe were evident, and undoubted. And yet not only <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> the Son of <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>Sheba</hi> the Son of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chri,</hi> but even two of his own Sons, lay Claim to the Soveraignty, and riſe up in Rebellion againſt him. A plain Proof, that where the Conſcience is large enough for <hi>Rebellion,</hi> it will eaſily ſlip thro' all other tyes of Nature and Gratitude. Theſe that could quit themſelves of their <hi>Allegiance,</hi> eaſily diſcharged their Filial Duties. He that can be a <hi>Traytor</hi> to the Father of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, will not ſcruple the breach of Fidelity to his Natural Parents: He that can be a <hi>Rebel</hi> to his King, will ſoon make nothing of being undutiful to his Father. We have a double inſtance of this in <hi>David,</hi> who was an Excellent King, and a moſt Indulgent Father, and yet, firſt his Son <hi>Abſalom,</hi> and here his Son <hi>Adonijah,</hi> ſaid, <hi>I will be King, and he prepared him Chariots and Horſemen, and fifty Men to run before Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He prepared Him Chariots and Horſemen and fifty men to run before him.</hi> Whether theſe Preparations were matters of State and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, ſuitable to that place of Dignity
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60508:3"/>and Honour he aſpir'd unto, or whether they were Preparations of Men, Arms, and Ammunition neceſſary to maintain his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. The ſame words are expreſſed of <hi>Abſalom,</hi> when he firſt began to ſet up for a <hi>Rebel,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.1. <hi>And it came to paſs that Abſalom prepared him Chariots and Horſemen, and fifty Men to run before him.</hi> Whether therefore theſe are Inſtances and Marks of Majeſty, the Royal Attendance, and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, (like the Kings Life-guard) and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they claim'd to be King's, they would be Royally, and like Soveraign Princes, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and waited on; or whether they were the <hi>joyning of other Rebels,</hi> a getting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of Men and Arms to Invade the King and his Subjects; and the preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Chariots and Horſemen, were the forming <hi>a Rebellious Army.</hi> Which of theſe two is meant, (by theſe words) is not ſo very certain. But it is certain, that not onely <hi>Abſalom</hi> but <hi>Adonijah</hi> alſo, (however theſe words are meant) did make ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, did invite and procure many of the Kings Subjects, <hi>(who were inclinable to Faction and Rebellion)</hi> to abet their Cauſe, to appear in their behalf, againſt their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Lawful Soveraign.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:60508:4"/>
            <p> In diſcourſing of theſe words I ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To conſider ſome Circumſtances re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to <hi>Adonijah</hi>'s Rebellion parallel to our own Caſe, to the late Rebellion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To repreſent the Iniquity of ſuch and all Rebellious Attempts and Practices.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To Apply the whole.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Reflect on ſome Circumſtances relating to <hi>Adonijah</hi>'s Rebellion, parallel to the late Rebellion; as, The Perſon. The Time of His Rebellion. The Occaſion of it. The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons aſſociating and aſſiſting. The Defeat.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Perſon, Adonijah the Son of Haggith.</hi> Who this <hi>Haggith</hi> was, whether <hi>David</hi>'s Wife, or his <hi>Concubine,</hi> is not expreſs'd; but it is probable, ſhe was ſome <hi>obſcure woman:</hi> And the Reaſon of this Conjecture is, that when there is mention made of <hi>David</hi>'s Sons, and of whom born, the <hi>Mothers</hi> are expreſt who they were in <hi>Lineage</hi> and <hi>Deſcent,</hi> except <hi>Haggith,</hi> and one more. So we read 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. and 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3. <hi>The firſt-born was</hi> Amnon <hi>of</hi> Ahinoam <hi>the Jezreeliteſs, the ſecond</hi> Chileab <hi>of</hi> Abigail <hi>the Wife of</hi> Nabal <hi>the Carmelite, the third</hi> Abſalom <hi>the Son of</hi> Maacha, <hi>the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60508:4"/>of</hi> Talmai <hi>King of</hi> Geſhur, <hi>the ſixth</hi> Ithream, <hi>by</hi> Eglah David'<hi>s Wife;</hi> but when it ſpeaks of <hi>Adonijah,</hi> and <hi>Shephatiah,</hi> it ſays only that the one <hi>was the Son of</hi> Haggith, <hi>the other of</hi> Abital, without any intimation from whence, or whoſe Daughters they were. Which (to me) ſeems that they were probably his <hi>Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines,</hi> or however <hi>of ſome mean Lineage, and low Extraction,</hi> otherwiſe there can hardly be a Reaſon aſſign'd, why the Country, Tribe, or Parentage of theſe ſhould not be mention'd as well as the other.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The time of</hi> Adonijah'<hi>s Rebellion,</hi> and that was ſome time before the Death of <hi>his Father, that Father</hi> that had been ſo extreamly kind to him, that to enhance the foulneſs of his Rebellion, 'tis ſaid immediately after the Text: <hi>And his Father had not diſpleaſed him at any time, in ſaying, why haſt thou done ſo?</hi> Nothing of diſpleaſure, but the <hi>higheſt kindneſs,</hi> the greateſt expreſſions of <hi>tenderneſs and affection</hi> had always been manifeſted from his <hi>Father.</hi> And herein we ſhall not need to make the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel. It only differs, That the <hi>Rebellion</hi> we are delivered from, did not break out in the time of the <hi>late King</hi> (of ever bleſſed memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) but it comes thus near, it was hatched then, and (in all probability) would have
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60508:5"/>then appear'd in its own colours, <hi>Rebellion and Treaſon mixed with the higheſt ingratitude and ill nature,</hi> had it not been providentially diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and ſeaſonably prevented: 'Twas then laid and contriv'd, and juſt ripe for acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but the Providence of God, and the Wiſdom and Vigilance of the King, ſtifled it, and hindered its further appearance: 'Twas the ſame then in Intention, and would have been the ſame (and probably worſe) in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, but that the Diſcovery brought ſome of the <hi>Conſpirators</hi> to puniſhment, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed the reſt, who ſince <hi>aſſociated</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves again, and <hi>(upon the Kings Mercy and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, and the Ruines of the Plot)</hi> have built up, and fram'd this <hi>ungrateful and unnatural Rebellion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The occaſion of this Rebellion,</hi> and that ſeems to be, that another had a <hi>better claim</hi> to the Government. There was <hi>another</hi> from God (after <hi>David</hi>) declared the <hi>rightful Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor of the Crown.</hi> God had eſtabliſhed it in <hi>Solomon,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> himſelf openly declares to the People. (1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.5. <hi>And of all my Sons, (for the Lord hath given me many Sons) he hath choſen</hi> Solomon <hi>my Son to ſit upon the Throne of the Kingdom of the Lord over</hi> Iſrael.
<note place="margin">1 Chron. 17.11, 12. &amp;c. 22.9.</note> And this very thing <hi>Adonijah</hi> himſelf afterwards ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60508:5"/>That the Kingdom was <hi>Solomon</hi>'s <hi>from the Lord.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Kings. 2.15.</note> Could <hi>Adonijah</hi> have been <hi>King</hi> after <hi>David</hi>'s deceaſe, 'tis probable he would not have moleſted him in his Life time; but when <hi>Solomon was to ſucceed,</hi> when he had a right from the Lord, before him; this grated his Spirits, and ſet him upon Projects, <hi>Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies and Aſſociations,</hi> to gain that by <hi>Fraud or Force,</hi> which he could not have by any <hi>Right, Law, or Juſtice.</hi> He had a mind to the Kingdom, and becauſe God would not give it him, he would indeavour to get it himſelf. We do not read indeed of a <hi>Black Box</hi> to juſtifie his falſe pretences, to make a legitimate Title of a ſpurious. But in every thing elſe the Parallel is too natural.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The Perſons aſſociating with him,</hi> and thoſe are expreſſed at the 7th Verſe. <hi>And he conferr'd with</hi> Joab <hi>the Son of</hi> Zeruiah, <hi>and</hi> Abiathar <hi>the Prieſt, and they following</hi> Adonijah <hi>helped him.</hi> And here I ſhould do a great deal of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice to <hi>Joab,</hi> and eſpecially to <hi>Abiathar,</hi> if I ſhould compare with them thoſe <hi>two Perſons</hi> that aſſiſted that late unhappy <hi>Gentleman</hi> in the <hi>Rebellion;</hi> they agree only in this, that the one was a Great Man, and the other a Prieſt; but in malignity and miſchief, ours, eſpecially the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> far exceed them.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:60508:6"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>Joab</hi> indeed was a man of Blood and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, he had baſely kill'd <hi>Abner</hi> and <hi>Amaſa,</hi> and now help'd <hi>Adonijah in his Rebellion;</hi> but before he had ſtood by King <hi>David,</hi> and ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him againſt <hi>Iſhboſheth,</hi> and the Rebellion of <hi>Abſalom</hi> and <hi>Sheba,</hi> and he had led forth his Armies, and return'd victorious from ſeveral of his Enemies. But what Service hath the <hi>late Peer</hi> ever done to the Government? If to promote a <hi>Faction,</hi> to incenſe the <hi>Mobile,</hi> to miſ-lead the King's Subjects, to be a <hi>Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator</hi> againſt his Life and Government, and to be <hi>actually in Arms</hi> againſt him; if theſe be ſervices, then this <hi>guilty man</hi> may have been ſerviceable to his King and Country. And (I conceive) no other inſtance, but ſuch as theſe, appears of good done by him to the Kingdom, <hi>except his being taken;</hi> and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is inſtrumental to the publick good, but that was ſorely againſt his will. And then for,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abiathar</hi> the Prieſt, it will be matter of the higheſt Injury, Defamation, and Indignity to his memory, to parallel with him in any Inſtance (except this Rebellion) <hi>That perfidious and Rebellious Prieſt, Contriver, Manager, and Aſſiſtant in the late Rebellion. Abiathar</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore had been a Good and <hi>Loyal</hi> man, true to the Intereſt of <hi>David.</hi> And <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60508:6"/>gives him this Character (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.26.) <hi>Thou bareſt the Ark of the Lord God before</hi> David <hi>my Father, and haſt been afflicted in all where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my Father was afflicted.</hi> And for that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he pardon'd him his Life, tho' <hi>(for his Rebellion,)</hi> he turn'd him out from being Prieſt of the Lord. But now, where is the man that can tell any one Inſtance of <hi>Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, Peaceableneſs,</hi> or <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> that ever came from the Mouth or Behaviour of this Man? <hi>Good Parts</hi> (they ſay) he has, and ſo had <hi>Achitophel,</hi> and ſo has the Devil; but ſurely, no Man ever reckon'd them the better for their Cunning: Dexterity of Underſtanding, Quickneſs of Mind, and Policy in Affairs, are good or bad, according as the Uſes are they are put to. If they tend to the Honour of God, the Good of the Church, the Peace of the Kingdom, or the Benefit of Mankind, they are truly Honourable and Worthy, and deſervedly admir'd and eſteem'd; but if they ſerve to unhinge the Government, to breed Factions, to diſquiet the People, to ſtir up Sedition, and Rebellion, they are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous and Reproachful; The better they are, the worſe they are, and greater Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Miſchief; and if an Ability to do harm, if a Power and Art to ſeduce, be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60508:7"/>of Character or Dignity, the great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer and Tempter, may put in for the greateſt ſhare, and firſt Station. <hi>And (I pray) to what uſe hath this man put his Parts?</hi> But to the carrying on the moſt Infamous and Vile Purpoſes. By a Poiſonous, and Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Cunning, to raiſe Diviſions and Schiſms in the Church, Uproars and Mutinies in the Kingdom; to contrive and aſſiſt in the moſt Villanous, and Helliſh <hi>Conſpiracy,</hi> that ever yet appeared in the World, and to Deſign and Abett an <hi>open and avowed Invaſion and Rebellion.</hi> Theſe are the Fruits of this man's Parts, the Effects of his Skill. And be it for ever confeſs'd, that he is a Man of Parts, that is, an <hi>Artiſt</hi> in his Way; a Man expert in all the Methods of <hi>Treaſon:</hi> And (to do him right) He hath refin'd Villany, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd the Science of <hi>Aſſaſſination,</hi> to a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Height, than any that were before Him. Curſed and Cruel Natures there have been, that have put off Humanity, and thirſted for Blood, yet few ever arrived to the pitch of this Man: You may think upon Cain <hi>and</hi> Zimri, <hi>upon the Servants of</hi> Jehoaſh <hi>and</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maziah, <hi>who conſpir'd againſt, and ſlew the Kings their Maſters; you may Reflect upon</hi> Caſſel, Parry, Garnet, <hi>the Murderers of King</hi> Charles
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60508:7"/>
               <hi>the Firſt, and all the Traytors, Conſpirators, and King-killers, that have yet appeared in the World;</hi> and amongſt them all, you will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find his Equal: 'Tis his Peculiar Talent, to have rais'd <hi>Treaſon,</hi> and <hi>Aſſaſſination,</hi> to a Degree above all Men; and let him have the Glory of his Parts, to have ſet out ſuch a piece of Miſchief, as no Wickedneſs can parallel, no Cruelty exceed. And as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſpeak to ſet forth the Excellency of a Mans Vertue or Wiſdome, ſo may it be ſaid of ſuch Eminency in Villany, <hi>Before him there have been none like him, neither after him ſhall be any ſuch.</hi> The Spirits of <hi>James Clement</hi> and <hi>Ravillac,</hi> were doubled on this Man; Each of Them Aſſaſſinated one King, but This was for the Murdering a <hi>Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</hi> This was the Man, that was for <hi>the Compendious Way, that is, for the Murdering (any how) at once, the Late and the Preſent King; This was the Man, that was ſo greedy of the Royal Blood, that he had raiſed</hi> 600 <hi>
                  <abbr>l.</abbr> to buy Arms for their quick Deſtruction; This was the Man that (in Murderous Perſwaſions and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) far out did all the reſt of the Villains; and This was the Man, that propos'd the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling five or ſix of the Richeſt Citizens, to give away their Eſtates, to ſtop the Mouths of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60508:8"/>multitude, when the firſt news of the Kings Murder ſhould reach them.</hi> And now are not theſe admirable Endowments, for a Man that calls himſelf a <hi>Miniſter of the Goſpel?</hi> Theſe are the Doctrines and Exhortations of <hi>Abaddon:</hi> Such Salvage and Murderous Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, will fit out a Chaplin to a <hi>Troup of Banditti,</hi> or a Company of <hi>Arabian Thieves and Robbers,</hi> whoſe Buſineſs and Imployment is to <hi>Steal and Murder,</hi> or (which is the ſame thing) to an <hi>Army of Rebels.</hi> The Chriſtian Inſtitution is too ſoft and gentle, too meek and mild for ſuch a hardned and overgrown Temper. But he may be well qualified for a Prieſt to thoſe Heathen Deities, delighted with Humane Sacrifices, who firſt ſlay Men, and then offer up the Fleſh and Blood to their Gods. <hi>Murder</hi> would then be, (even as now it is) the Exerciſe of his Religion, and <hi>Prieſtly Function.</hi> It is not in my Nature, to ſpeak hardly or reproachfully of any Man, but who can be Temperate on ſuch an Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion? A Man whoſe Profeſſion is Peace and Piety, to be Author of the moſt <hi>Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Councils,</hi> and to be a Miniſter of the Higheſt Wickedneſs, is a Prodigy and a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; A Bloody Villain, in the Shape of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, is a Devil in the Name of God; and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60508:8"/>there is nothing in this World comes ſo near <hi>Satan</hi> transforming himſelf into an Angel of Light; as a Man pretending he is a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of Chriſt, and at the ſame time to be a <hi>Traytor, and a Rebel, a Murderer, and a Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>His Defeat:</hi> And this was very ſudden; for as ſoon as <hi>Adonijah,</hi> and his <hi>Aſſociators</hi> heard that <hi>Solomon</hi> was crowned King, that Zadock <hi>and</hi> Nathan, <hi>and</hi> Benaiah, <hi>and the</hi> Cherethites, <hi>and the</hi> Pelethites, (Men of Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, Vertue, and Courage) ſtood by the <hi>Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Succeſſor and Lawful King,</hi> againſt the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions of <hi>Adonijah,</hi> they were preſently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may'd and diſpers'd. 'Tis probable, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected more of the Kings Subjects to have joyn'd them, that all the <hi>Diſcontented</hi> in the Land, or the <hi>Remainders of Abſalom's Rebellion,</hi> would have flock'd in unto them. But when by the ſuddenneſs of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Crowning, and the expeditious meeting of the <hi>Loyal Party,</hi> they ſaw themſelves overpower'd, they broke up their Rebellious Meeting, and <hi>every Man went his way,</hi> v. 41. Now the Caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us (in this particular) is not every way Parallel; the Late <hi>Rebels</hi> were not ſo very ſoon defeated, but (thanks be to God) it was not long; they did ſome Miſchief firſt, and kill'd
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60508:9"/>ſome Loyal and Good Men, but the <hi>Kings</hi> Care and Induſtry prevented them from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much: So ſoon as they came to a picht Fight, God (whoſe Name be prais'd) gave the Victory to his Majeſties Forces, and the <hi>Rebels</hi> were totally routed. And This is the Matter of our Thankſgiving, and the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of this Day. So it is Parallel in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatneſs of their Diſſipation, tho' not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the ſuddenneſs of it. 'Tis Parallel in the chearful and ready appearance of the <hi>King's Loyal and Dutiful Subjects</hi> to Oppoſe (with their Lives and Fortunes) all falſe Claims and Pretenſions whatſoever.</p>
            <p>And ſo I have done with the firſt thing. Reflecting on ſome Circumſtances, relating to <hi>Adonijah</hi>'s Rebellion, parallel to the <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion</hi> we have been delivered from. I have not indeed been ſo very exact and punctual, as to point out every parallel, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare every particular; but where I have not, the Things are ſo very plain and obvious, that they compare themſelves, and it would be needleſs to do that, which every Man's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding cannot but ſupply.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>To Repreſent the Iniquity of ſuch, and all Rebellious Attempts and Practices.</hi> And this (I muſt confeſs) is more than I can do;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60508:9"/>they are Evils of ſuch a Size, as exceed all the Powers I have, and ſurpaſs all the Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation I can make. Some Miſchiefs, like ſome Sorrows, are ſo great, that they ſilence all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, they aſtoniſh our Faculties, and are too big for vent. As there are Extaſies of Joy, and Agonies of Pain, things that may be felt and conceiv'd, but are ſo High, that no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription reaches them. So there are Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſences of Villany, a kind of inexpreſſible Wickedneſs, which damps and ſtupifies, the thoughts of which overcharge the Spirits, and poſſeſs us with a kind of Extatic Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and Confuſion. I can tell you what <hi>Fraud and Injuſtice</hi> is, and I can deſcribe <hi>Theft and Murder</hi> to you: I can lay open the Vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>unnatural Parricide: But all theſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and more; the Diſmal Contrivances of Aſſaſſination, the Horrid Conſequences of a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious Army the united Miſchiefs of Treaſon and Rebellion;</hi> who can tell what to call them? Or where are words bad enough to expreſs them? They overwhelm our Minds, and are not ſo properly Objects of our ſpeech, as of our amazement. I ſhall not therefore undertake the full Repreſentation, (for that is more than I can do); but we may (beſides many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) make ſome Conception of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60508:10"/>Miſchiefs of it, in theſe two following Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As it violates all the Principles of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Society.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As 'tis contrary to the Nature and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As it violates the Principles of Humane Society.</p>
            <p>The Fundamental Principles of all Humane Society, are the ſecuring every Man's Right, and the Preſervation of the whole. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaks of a Time, when <hi>every Man ſhall ſit under his Vine,
<note place="margin">Micah. 4.4.</note> and under his Fig-Tree, and none ſhall make them afraid.</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 3.</note> But when is this? <hi>When Men ſhall beat their Swords into Plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhares, and their Spears into Pruning-hooks.</hi> But not when there are <hi>Rebels</hi> in the Land, who do quite contrary, <hi>who beat their Plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhares into Swords, and their Pruning-books in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Spears.</hi> No man can ſit under his Vine, can be at eaſe and rejoyce in his Labours, and reap the Fruits of his Care and Induſtry, when Injuſtice and Spoyl lye at the Doors. What can we call our own? Or what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty can ſecure us? When there are men of Prey and Violence, that will ſeize our Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, and take the Meat of our Mouths. What Juſtice to our Rights can be expected
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60508:10"/>from theſe Men? Whoſe whole Pretence and Buſineſs is invading the <hi>Rights of our Soveraign.</hi> And this (I doubt not) hath been ſadly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented by many the Inhabitants of thoſe Counties that were the Seat of the Late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. We have a Right to our <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>to our King.</hi> To our <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Poſſeſſions.</hi> To our <hi>Families,</hi> and <hi>Relations:</hi> And all theſe are violated by Rebellion. <hi>Rebellion</hi> is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive Evil, and contains in it all that is Vile. 'Tis not one ſingle Sin, but all. 'Tis not onely <hi>Rebellion,</hi> (and yet that is bad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough) but 'tis <hi>Treaſon,</hi> and <hi>Theft,</hi> and <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and <hi>Perjury</hi> beſides. Conſider therefore what it is to have your <hi>God</hi> Diſhonour'd, your <hi>King</hi> Injur'd, your <hi>Religion</hi> Prophan'd, your <hi>Goods</hi> Plunder'd, your <hi>Churches</hi> Rob'd, your <hi>Perſons</hi> Kill'd, your <hi>Wives</hi> Raviſh'd, and your <hi>Daughters</hi> Deflour'd. Conſider the Tears of Widows and Orphans, the loſs of Children, the Demoliſhing of Edifices, the Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Corn and Cattel, and all the Ravages and Devaſtations of Mercileſs and Blood-thirſty Men. And Theſe, and all Theſe, and much more than Theſe, is Rebellion; In ſhort, 'tis all the Evil the wiſeſt Men can think, and the worſt Men can act.</p>
            <p>But yet there is another Right in Humane
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60508:11"/>Society, and that is the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Right.</hi> For ſure the <hi>Crown</hi> is not a Prize, that every Man may put in and Fight for, but a Matter of Right, an Ancient and Hereditary Right. It would certainly be one of the ſtrangeſt things in the World; That when every Man's Property is ſecur'd, and made ſo by the <hi>King</hi>'s Laws and Power, and yet He himſelf ſhould have none; That every Man ſhould enjoy the Benefit of Laws, and Society, and the <hi>King</hi> (the Head of the Society) ſhould be in <hi>Hobs's</hi> State of Nature, and every Man had a Right to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing of His. And if a Man can but get together Men and Arms, (tho' he cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Injuſtice to a farthing of any Man's elſe, yet) he may lay Claim to the <hi>King's</hi> Crown and Dignity. 'Tis Injury and Theft to deſire, or take away but a penny-worth of ours: And is it nothing to Uſurp upon the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to Invade the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Dues, His Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and Inheritance?</hi> Theſe are, and always have been eſteem'd the moſt Sacred and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable. All Societies have been ſo extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tender of the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Rights,</hi> that the leaſt viſible Violation of them, hath always (in the Eye of the Laws) been accounted a Crime of an extraordinary Nature. The Scriptures (in this particular) confine our very Thoughts,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60508:11"/>much more all overt Acts. The <hi>King</hi> hath a Right to our Honour and Eſteem, and his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and Dignity are wrong'd by inſolent Thoughts, and undue Eſtimations; much more ſure, by Reproachful Words, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Behaviour. There is a kind of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the Perſons of <hi>King</hi>'s, which breeds Awe and Dread, Diſtance and Reverence; and there cannot be a greater Inſtance of a Profligate Wretch,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.10.</note> than to break down the Pale of Majeſty, and not to <hi>be afraid to ſpeak Evil of Dignities.</hi> But when there are Men that defie God, and Contemn the Divine Majeſty, it is not to be wondered, if they do as much to his Vicegerent; if there are <hi>State-Atheiſts,</hi> who have ſo far ſhaken off all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and Duty, as impiouſly to vilifie the Perſons, and attempt upon the Intereſts and Safeties of <hi>Kings.</hi> But theſe have been always accounted the Peſts of the Earth, who have violated all the Principles of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and broke through all the Bonds of Society; Men who have defy'd God, Nature, and the Laws. The <hi>King</hi>'s Honour, Perſon, Life, and Government, have been always ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd by all the Tyes and Fences that Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Law can make, and an Invaſion of Them, is the higheſt Sin a Man in Society can be guilty of.</p>
            <pb n="20" facs="tcp:60508:12"/>
            <p> And this is not only the Senſe of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, but manifeſt alſo from the Nature of the thing. Without This, Society can never be preſerv'd, the Kingdom and the Intereſts of it ſecur'd, and the Ends of Government an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd. For 'tis a vain thing to expect this, where the Supream and Governing Power is expos'd to Outrage and Violence. How can the Kingdom be ſecure, if the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be not? How ſhould the <hi>King</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect his People, and adminiſter Juſtice, and Right among them? If he himſelf is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, if his own Rights are open to Invaſion. It is neceſſary therefore for our ſakes, as well as for the <hi>King</hi>'s, that his Rights be maintain'd. Every Stroke againſt Him, is a Wound to the whole Kingdom. Every Injury to Him, is Injuſtice to all the People. And (whatever diſtinctions Republican Men may make be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Court and the Countrey) the <hi>King</hi>'s Rights are the beſt preſervative of the Peoples, and the Security of the Government, is the beſt Hold any Man hath for his own Safety. If the <hi>King</hi>'s Right be liable to Queſtion and Uncertainty, to be diſputed by the Claims, and Pretences of every Man that hath a Mind to it; like a Diſeaſe in the Head, it affects the whole Body, and the whole Kingdom
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60508:12"/>will be always in Palſies, Tremblings, and Convulſions, there can be nothing of Peace and Order, all will be Confuſion and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtion, it will be in a perpetual State of War, and every Man againſt every Man.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi>'s Security therefore, and the Preſervation of his Rights, hath the greateſt Influence on the Good of the whole, and is the moſt neceſſary Principle of Publick Safety. And Conſequently, that muſt be a very great Evil, that Infringes or Invades them. For pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the Excellency and Goodneſs of a Thing that is Violated, muſt be the Malignity of that which Violates it. As words that are but a Scandal, or a threatning againſt a Common Man, may be Treaſon, when ſpoke againſt the King, and Blaſphemy when againſt God. Rebellion therefore is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Offence that can be committed, with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to Humane Society. Both as it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Sacred Perſon of the King;</hi> and alſo as it undermines that Power, Authority, and Protection, which is Neceſſary to the Security of all Publick Societies. The Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates of the Late
<note n="*" place="margin">Cromwel.</note> Uſurper, make uſe of this Argument.
<note place="margin">Hobs Leviathan.</note> That <hi>becauſe he had got the Force and Protection of the Kingdom into his Hands, he was to be obey'd, and not to be reſiſted, for
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60508:13"/>that the Attempts againſt Him would hazard the publick ſafety,
<note place="margin">Hall <hi>of</hi> Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond <hi>of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Obedience.</hi>
                  </note> &amp;c.</hi> The ſtrength of which (as it Relates to Uſurpation, and the Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Means of attaining the Government) I ſhall not now examine;
<note place="margin">White <hi>of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Dr.</hi> J. Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win, <hi>Quaeries. And generally all that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took that vſur pers Cauſe, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Succeſs.</hi>
               </note> only infer, that the Argument is much more forcible againſt <hi>Rebellion and Reſiſtance;</hi> when the Power and Government is in the Hands of <hi>a Lawful and undoubted Soveraign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Nature and Conſtitution of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity. And in the whole Tenor of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there is ſcarce any thing of any kind, but what directly oppoſes all Rebellious Attempts and Practices. Let us look upon thoſe Graces that adorn Chriſtianity, that are the moſt Eminent in Religion, and we ſhall find, they are utterly inconſiſtent with a Spirit of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</hi> There is <hi>Truth, Humility, Modeſty, Meekneſs and Juſtice;</hi> And there is <hi>Charity, Patience, Forgiveneſs, Peaceableneſs, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedneſs.</hi> And are theſe <hi>Rebellious Vertues?</hi> Do theſe teach Men to be Unquiet and Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious? To be Uneaſie and Impatient under Government? To vilifie and reproach their Governours? To ſeek the Rights of other Men? And to Invade the <hi>Crown?</hi> Nothing in the whole World is ſo contrary. In ſhort, theſe are Vertues, without which 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60508:13"/>to be a Chriſtian, and with which 'tis impoſſible to be a <hi>Rebel.</hi> And if Religion had done no more but this, if it had only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd Men to be Humble and Honeſt, to be Patient and Contented, to be Peaceable and Orderly in their Stations; it had been abundantly ſufficient, to reſtrain any Man, (that had but the leaſt Conſcience, or Senſe of Religion) from being <hi>Mutinous, Factious, or Rebellious.</hi> For let a Man but Conſcientiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerve any one of theſe Vertues, and 'tis as impoſſible for him, (while he does ſo) to be a <hi>Traytor,</hi> as 'tis for a man (at the ſame time) to be a Chriſtian and a Turk. But Chriſtianity hath gone much further; It hath not left the Meaſures of our Obedience in Generals, but hath given particular and expreſs Orders concerning it; and thoſe as Direct, Peremptory, and Full, as any Laws ever have, or can make. It commands us <hi>to give the King his Dues;</hi> and that ſure is not by <hi>Invading his Birth-right;</hi> it enjoyns us <hi>to pray for Him,</hi> and that is not done by Vilifying and Aſperſing Him, by penning and ſending forth <hi>Reproachful and Treaſonable Declarations againſt Him.</hi> It obliges <hi>to obey Him for Conſcience ſake;</hi> and this is not done by Contemning <hi>His Authority,</hi> and diſowning
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60508:14"/>
               <hi>His Government.</hi> It Commands us (if there be Occaſion) <hi>to Suffer, but upon no account to Reſiſt;</hi> and this ſure is not comply'd with by <hi>bearing of Arms,</hi> and riſing in <hi>Actual Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion</hi> againſt Him. Now theſe Injunctions of the Goſpel are as plain and poſitive as words can make them: And it is not poſſible to find out Words more expreſs and full than theſe. <hi>Let every Soul be ſubject unto the Higher Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:
<note place="margin">Rom. 13.1.2.</note> Whoſoever reſiſteth the Power, reſiſteth the Ordinance of God, and they that reſiſt, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to themſelves Damnation.</hi> Theſe are ſo plain, that a man that owns Chriſtianity, muſt have a ſtrange Conſcience, to evade the Force of them. Thoſe therefore that have had Wickedneſs enough to <hi>Rebel,</hi> and would fain draw in Religion for Countenance, have been very hard put to it, to ſhift the Evidence and Strength of theſe Precepts. They are ſo clear, that they cannot do with them, (as they do with ſome other parts of Scripture) wreſt them to a contrary ſenſe, (for no man can believe that <hi>Libelling the King</hi> is praying for Him, or that riſing up againſt him <hi>with Swords and Guns</hi> is not reſiſting him.) They therefore fall foul upon them, and tell you, <hi>Theſe were Doctrines calculated for the firſt Times,

But are no Rules, and binding, where is Men, Arms, and ſtrength enough.</hi> This indeed makes quick Work of it, and if it were ſufficient, would preſently evacuate all the Precepts of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; you might be as licentious and Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous as you pleas'd, you might be as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful, Cruel, and Uncharitable as you thought fit; you might Cheat and Defraud as many as you could; 'tis but ſaying, the Precepts of Forgiveneſs, Meekneſs, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, were accommodated for the firſt Times, and all is well, and your Conſcience at eaſe. Suppoſe a Man had a mind to kill his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Murder his Maſter, and poſſeſs himſelf of his Goods, 'tis but ſaying, the Commands of Duty to Parents, and Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Maſters, are Temporary, and there is no harm done. I know they do not ſay ſo; but I know likewiſe, that no Mortal Man can give a reaſon, why the one ſhould be temporary, and not the other; there is no ſuch limitation expreſs'd in one, more than the other, and if the Nature of the thing be conſulted, there is more Reaſon for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Obligation to Obedience: For Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is perpetual, and ſo muſt Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60508:15"/>be too, for they are Relatives. And Obedience to Government is more neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (with reference to the welfare of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind) than either Common Honeſty or Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial Duty. And I wonder what thoſe (that urge this) can ſay to that Text, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 13.5.) <hi>Ye muſt needs be Subject, not only for Wrath, but alſo for Conſcience ſake. Not only for Wrath,</hi> that is, not only becauſe the King hath a <hi>coercive Power, and can Compel and Puniſh,</hi> (which is the very thing, and all that they inſiſt upon) but alſo upon another ground, <hi>for Conſcience ſake,</hi> with Reſpect to God, and Chriſt, and the Principles of his Religion; which in another place, is therefore expreſs'd, <hi>for the Lord's ſake,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. Chriſtian O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is founded, not <hi>in Force,</hi> becauſe the Government is ſtronger; but <hi>in Conſcience,</hi> becauſe God commands it. All the Duties of Religion are to be done for Conſcience ſake; but 'tis ſomewhat remarkable, That (of all the reſt) this only of <hi>Subjection to Authority,</hi> ſhould be ſo expreſs'd; which as it eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the great Streſs the Goſpel lays upon this Duty, ſo it takes away all manner of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giverſation and ſubterfuge, (for hereby all <hi>Rebellious</hi> Diſtinctions and Pretences are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated.) <hi>Conſcience</hi> is always pretended for <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion;</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:60508:15"/>and can there be any thing more plain, than that we <hi>muſt needs be Subject for Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſake;</hi> that is, from a Principle of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from the Laws of the Goſpel, the ſame Principle that is the Guide and Rule of our Conſciences? 'Tis not therefore the <hi>King's</hi> Power and Strength, but the <hi>Conſcience</hi> of our Duty to God, that makes Chriſtians o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey. There are two Obligations to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; the one is <hi>Coertion,</hi> and this is over Brutes, or Brutiſh Natures, ungovernable and Seditious Tempers, that need Force and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, and muſt be held as with a Bridle. The other is <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and this is a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over Good Men, who yield a Free and Generous Obedience, as acting under the Laws and Authority of Chriſt. Every good Chriſtian lives in Subjection by Vertue of his Religion, and the Principles of his <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi> And (to come yet further, to this ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Objection) Chriſtian Religion (which is the Law of Conſcience, and the Director of all Chriſtians actions) is not a fraudulent and deceitful Inſtitution; to accommodate its Doctrines (as theſe Men repreſent it) to Times and Seaſons, and not to the Nature of things, and Rules of Common Equity. To teach Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence only <hi>to ſerve a turn with,</hi> to order Men to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60508:16"/>be patient and ſubmiſſive, <hi>till they could get Numbers to be otherwiſe,</hi> is the moſt diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and Baſe, and the Fowleſt thing that can be ſaid of any Inſtitution; it makes it not a ſtaid Rule of Practice, but a Cheat and Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan. There may be Evil Men, that can ſhew Tricks, and make fair Shews, till they have opportunity to do their Miſchief. But this is not poſſible for a Law, and much leſs for the beſt of Laws, the Goſpel, which is always e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and true, always the ſame to day, to morrow, and for ever. The firſt Chriſtians were to <hi>obey, and not to Reſiſt their Rulers,</hi> and ſo are we; and that not for Reaſons variable and alterable, according to Times and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but by a ſtanding Rule, <hi>by Conſcience,</hi> a perpetual Principle, binding to us, and to all Chriſtians to the end of the World. The Law therefore is Good, but there are bad Men, who would fain Transform it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their own Likeneſs; They are quiet when they dare not be otherwiſe, and reſolve to be in Subjection, but till they can get ſtrength to <hi>Rebel;</hi> and they would put this Vizor on Religion, and make Chriſtianity as Hypocritical as themſelves. They will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey no longer than there is Force to make them. And Thanks be to God, the <hi>King</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:60508:16"/>hath been ſtrong enough for them; and God grant He may always be ſo, to keep thoſe in their <hi>Allegiance</hi> by his Power, whom no <hi>Conſcience</hi> can hold, no <hi>Principles of Religion</hi> can contain in their Duty.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Apply the Whole.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Let us diſpoſe our Hearts and Souls, to give unfeigned Thanks and Praiſe to the moſt Gracious God, for Influencing and proſpering His Majeſties Forces, and Defeating our Enemies.</hi> For this purpoſe we are now met together, and to this, the Nature of the Thing, and the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Diſcourſe engages us. For if <hi>Rebellion</hi> be (as you have heard, and as in realitty it is) the worſt of Evils, the moſt Pernicious to all Governments and Societies: Then let the Senſe of our Deliverance from it, Influence our Hearts, with ſutable Affections, and Devotion to our Deliverer. 'Tis true, <hi>Rebellion</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Claims</hi> do very ſeldom prevail, God (who is the Patron of Right) uſually Protects the juſt Cauſe, exerts his Providence in the behalf of the Innocent, and will not ſuffer Right to be oppreſs'd by an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper, and wrongful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vader.</hi> And we (of this Nation) have had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Inſtances of God's Power and Goodneſs, who hath often miraculouſly appear'd in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the <hi>Rightful Title to the Crown.</hi> But this
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60508:17"/>ſhould not diminiſh, but advance our Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: And the more Experience we have had of Almighty Mercy, the more ſhould we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large our ſelves towards Him in expreſſions of Duty. We owe much indeed to the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Care,</hi> to the <hi>Parliaments Pious and Loyal Indeavours,</hi> to the <hi>Valour and Conduct of the King's Military Officers,</hi> to the <hi>Reſolution and Courage of the Souldiers.</hi> To all which reſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (in their differing Spheres and Stations) is our praiſe and thanks proportionably due. But let God have his Honour alſo; Men are but In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, God is the Supream Actor, and all Succeſſes (how wiſely ſoever things are mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged) depend upon His Providence. The Wretches themſelves that contriv'd the <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid and Black Rye-Aſſaſſination,</hi> when they were diſappointed by a Wonderful Providence,
<note place="margin">Fire at New-Market.</note> could ſay, that <hi>Gods Hand was in it.</hi> And let us ſure (who reap the Benefit of that and this preſent Deliverance) be as forward to ſee, and alſo to acknowledge the <hi>Divine Clemency,</hi> which reſcu'd <hi>our King,</hi> and our ſelves, from the Hands, and Outrages of Ravenous and Bloody Men.

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Let us follow our Thanksgiving home, let us purſue it into our Conſciences, that it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a principle of Life and Action:</hi> They are but cold and empty Words, ſent into the Air, which do not beat back upon our Hearts, and affect us with Piety and Duty.
